/**
 * The answer for a batch or pipeline-batch parent whose finalize failed, or
 * null when its row is not settled as failed.
 *
 * A failed finalize commits its reason to the parent row before it rethrows,
 * but the rejection that reaches the route through BullMQ is a plain Error,
 * which the error handler would mask as "Internal server error". The row is
 * what the sync client and API consumers must see (#1161). Storage faults
 * answer 503 wherever they surface, so a client keys on one status and code
 * for "the instance can't store this" (#1161, #1421).
 *
 * A row that can't be read answers null as well, so the caller rethrows the
 * rejection it already holds instead of replacing it with a database error.
 *
 * A row still in flight is read again for a short while. A finalize that died
 * by stall (or crashed on another replica) is settled only by the worker's
 * failed handler, which doesn't await its write, so its rejection can reach
 * the route first (#2209).
 * The wait is bounded so a rejection with no reason behind it still rethrows
 * promptly.
